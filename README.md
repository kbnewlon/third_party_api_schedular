Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This all runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. When I open the panner to create the schedule then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. There are nine timeblocks to represent the workday. Each timeblock will have a color to determine the past, present, or future time. I can use the schedular by clicking the block and typing my events. I can clear my events by clicking the button at the top of the screen.
